Need to submit a request to fetch the http...

Command : curl -I head -i http://mercury.picoctf.net:53554/index.php

-i/--include

(HTTP) Include the HTTP-header in the output. The HTTP-header includes things like server-name, date of the document, HTTP-version and more...
 
If this option is used twice, the second will again disable header include.


-I/--head

(HTTP/FTP/FILE) Fetch the HTTP-header only! HTTP-servers feature the command HEAD which this uses to get nothing but the header of a document. When used on a FTP or FILE file, curl displays the file size and last modification time only.

If this option is used twice, the second will again disable header only.
